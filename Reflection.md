Good luck!
During this lab I became confident using GitHub and understanding its importance such as the ability to collaborate and create proposals. I have learned about repositories and how the master owns the master branch which then allows developers to fork the repository and create their own branch which can be modified and changed. Then a pull request is preformed which then the master can merge the code.
